Noto is a custom heads up display for use within the game Team Fortress 2, created by omnibombulator. It is a flat designed HUD, which incorporates some original design techniques that other Team Fortress 2 HUDs now recreate, most notably the User Interface for the Vaccinator Weapon.

Noto supports all game modes and types, including competitive game modes like 6v6 and Highlander, with it's many different scoreboard variations. Noto includes 6 variations of scoreboard, from as little as 6v6, all the way up to 16v16.

Noto also includes a Minimal HUD, and boasts more customizable features, with a heavily in-depth readme to help you understand how to change the HUD elements you desire.
