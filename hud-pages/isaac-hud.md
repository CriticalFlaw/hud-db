A unique and simple HUD with a goal of providing a different experience than most HUDs.

IMPORTANT REMINDER ABOUT INSTALLING!  
A lot of users reported that the hud doesnt work after extracting. When you download the Zip file and open it you have to open the "Isaachud-master" folder and extract the "IsaacHud" folder to your "custom" folder from there.
