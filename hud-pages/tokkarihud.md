TokkariHUD is my own personal HUD modification for TF2.

My goal with this HUD was to retain the style of TF2 while doing away with aspects I don't like, while adding my own style and personal flare - as well as taking inspiration from old TF2 menus and The Orange Box.
I'll be updating the HUD based on feedback as well as generally maintaining and touching it up.

Note: Minmode and Comp are not supported. And the HUD is only designed for 16:9
