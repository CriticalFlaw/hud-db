FrankenHUD is a client-side modification for Team Fortress 2 that alters the HUD to be more stylish; cleaner, but without sacrificing the game's aesthetics and stuffing everything next to the crosshair. The name is due to it being originally based off of bits and pieces from other community-made HUDs... it’s since sort of evolved into it’s own beast.

It sort of started as my own personal modifications in my spare time, but I eventually shared them with the internet and found a decent amount of interest, so it seemed like a good idea to keep updating and maintaining it! I hope you like it!
