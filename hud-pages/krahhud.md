**1 YEAR? ALREADY? Yeah... Wow**

While using Bothud, I came across many problems, mainly involving the colors. Through out my use of the hud, I tweeked it to my own liking, then randomly thought "Fuck it" and decided to make this a 'thing'

And that's where this was really born.

The base hud is BotHUD, Made by Playmoo and used by the popular youtuber J_peg.

In The README File I go over this in more detail. Most of the things in the hud (elements etc) are not mine and were just extracted from other huds, I am in no way, shape or form, claiming ownership to them. thank you.

Very, very big thank you to the Huds.tf discord for answering questions and helping with the (very many) problems I had along the way. if you yourself want to get into hud editing, I highly recommend joining the server, don't be afraid to ask for help.

**BEFORE YOU EXTRACT THE HUD:**  
Please Go into the Folder called "INSTALL BEFORE USE"

**Installation :**  
Click the Download ZIP button to download the compressed archive

Find your Steam install directory and go to **\SteamApps\Common\Team Fortress 2\tf**

Make a folder called 'custom' if you don't already have one

Extract the KrahHUD folder from the zip file into the custom folder.
