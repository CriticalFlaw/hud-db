A HUD for those that like to keep their eyes in the center of the screen, while also riffing on the default HUD's aesthetic. Built heavily off of e.v.e HUD with elements inspired by several other HUDs.

This HUD is designed for one to turn HUD minmode on to use sweetHud, and to turn minmode off to use the underlying e.v.e HUD with enhancements.
I will note that personally I have used this hud with the "Overpass font override" for the last ~3 years, as opposed to the default TF2 Build font.

Sinders - Overall HUD would not have been created without the wonderful starting block of e.v.e HUD.
